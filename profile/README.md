# Dead Developer Society
This is a group of Hong Kong Developers who give up Hong Kong and try to start a new life in Canada and yet still unable to find a job for more than 3 months.

We would like to develop sth great that could benefit the world and train both our business skills and technical skills. Thats why we group together and code in our free time
